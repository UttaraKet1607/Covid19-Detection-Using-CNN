# Covid19-Detection-Using-CNN

The exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cases is overwhelming for the hospitals creating shortage of radiologists, doctors and also the testing kits. 
The code consists of a deep learning aided system that uses chest X-rays of patients for the diagnosis of Covid-19.

The system architecture is as shown below:

The stages of implementation are as follows:
-	Data gathering and preprocessing. 
-	Understanding the data and labels.
-	Developing model architecture and fitting the data.
-	Training the model on predefined metrics- accuracy, in this case.
-	Graphical respresentation of the results.
-	Testing the model.
